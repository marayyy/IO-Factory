He owns a strip of land and can choose to develop it with different types of properties: Theatres, Pubs, and Commercial Parks. Each property has a specific construction time and occupies a certain area of land. The goal is to determine the optimal mix of properties to develop within a given time period in order to maximize Mr. X's earnings. The earnings are based on the type of property developed and the duration it is operational. The challenge is to find the combination of properties that generates the highest possible profit within the specified time frame."],"metadata":{"id":"5AYJnhEtPGcg"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oX7wvWPNFFlP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687237547126,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3847,"user":{"displayName":"Raj Kumar","userId":"10858536432817015099"}},"outputId":"d0dddb83-a4dc-4e2b-e73e-3a9b59e6a057"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["13\n","Time Unit: 13\n","Earnings: $ 16500\n","Solutions: T: 2 P: 0 C: 0\n"]}],"source":["asset_count = [0, 0, 0]  # No of assets (Pub, Theatre, Commercial Park)\n","time_unit = [4, 5, 10]  # Time units required to build each property\n","\n","def entire_earnings(n):\n","    profit = 0\n","    profit_gained = [0, 0, 0]  # Profit for each property\n","\n","    if n < 4:\n","        return 0  # assets which can not be developed with less than 4 time units\n","\n","    # Calculate profit based on remaining time\n","    remaining_time = n - 4\n","    profit_gained[0] = remaining_time * 1000\n","    if n >= 5:\n","        remaining_time = n - 5\n","        profit_gained[1] = remaining_time * 1500\n","        if n >= 10:\n","            remaining_time = n - 10\n","            profit_gained[2] = remaining_time * 3000\n","\n","    max_index = profit_gained.index(max(profit_gained))\n","    profit += profit_gained[max_index]\n","    asset_count[max_index] += 1\n","\n","    return profit + entire_earnings(n - time_unit[max_index])  # Calculate earnings for remaining time units\n","\n","\n","n = int(input())\n","earnings = entire_earnings(n)\n","\n","print('Time Unit:',n)\n","print(\"Earnings: $\",earnings)\n","print(\"Solutions: T:\", asset_count[1],\"P:\",asset_count[0],\"C:\",asset_count[2])"]}]}
